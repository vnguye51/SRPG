    <p>The goal of the game is to defeat all enemies. Enemy characters are colored in red with their stats appearing on the left box. Your characters are colored in blue with their stats appearing on the rightmost box</p>

    <p>Clicking on a character will reveal their possible movement</p>
    <p>Click on one of the blue tiles to move to that location</p>
    <p>Then click on one of the red tiles to select a target to attack.</p>
    <p>Good luck!</p>
